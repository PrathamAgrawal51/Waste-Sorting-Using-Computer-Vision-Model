# 🗑️ Waste Sorting Using Computer Vision  

A deep learning-based **waste classification model** that automatically identifies and sorts waste into different categories using **computer vision**.  

## 🚀 Features  

- 📷 **Image-based Waste Detection** – Classifies waste into categories (e.g., plastic, paper, metal, organic).  
- 🎯 **CNN Model for Classification** – Uses a pre-trained **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** for accurate sorting.  
- 📊 **Real-time Prediction** – Process waste images and predict categories instantly.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  

- **Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras**  
- **Pre-trained CNN**

## 🚀 Usage
